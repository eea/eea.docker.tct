La biodiversite est un atout socio-economique important et l'integration des problemes lies a la biodiversite dans les politiques sectorielles profite egalement au secteur dans la mesure ou elle encourage une utilisation durable de cette ressource.</p>\n\n<p>Plusieurs secteurs revetent une importance particuliere par rapport a la biodiversite : l'amenagement spatial exerce un impact majeur sur la biodiversite, il peut jouer un role essentiel dans la fragmentation de l'habitat et peut engendrer des pressions de developpement incontrolees sur la biodiversite : les secteurs de l'industrie, du transport et de l'energie peuvent avoir des incidences mondiales et regionales sur la biodiversite a travers le changement climatique et l'acidification. Ils peuvent en outre avoir des incidences locales a travers la fragmentation des habitats, la destruction des habitats et la perturbation de la vie sauvage, etc. L'objectif 2010 ne pourra etre atteint que si tous les secteurs pertinents integrent l'aspect de la biodiversite dans leurs plans et leur politique.</p>\n\n<p>Il faut egalement preter une attention soutenue a l'implication du secteur prive dans les questions liees a la biodiversite.

They were primarily used by and exchanged between agricultural and breeders communities. Specific prospection with a view to develop industrial commercial production (e.g. of drugs, glues, resins, paints, scents, refreshments, etc.) is a development of the last century. Prospectors were free to take these resources from their countries of origin and use them to develop commercial products such as pharmacologically active compounds. The CBD opens the door for a new approach to bioprospecting activities by recognising the sovereign rights of countries over their genetic resources. The CBD encourages the fair and equitable sharing of the results of research and development, and of the benefits arising from the commercial use and other forms of utilisation of genetic resources, with the country providing these resources. This means that countries providing genetic resources (often countries in the Southern Hemisphere, boasting a huge wealth of biodiversity) have the authority to determine access conditions to their genetic resources.</p>\n\n<p>To access genetic resources, users of genetic resources must:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>gain permission from the country providing genetic resources to collect or use genetic resources or knowledge before the activity takes place (Prior Informed Consent*) </li>\n<li>conclude the terms for exchange with the provider country (Mutually Agreed Terms*) </li>\n<li>share, in a fair and equitable manner, the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources with providers of genetic resources (Fair and Equitable Benefit-Sharing). These benefits may be monetary or non-monetary (research or commercial partnerships, samples of what is collected, participation or training of national researchers, transfer of biotechnology equipment and know-how, etc.). As bioprospecting activities usually involve taking small samples of material, its impact on biodiversity as such is relatively limited. However, the respect of the ABS dispositions of the CBD is of paramount importance for biodiversity as it provides a direct incentive for the world's biologically richer (but often economically poorer) countries and the indigenous peoples and local communities who are the custodians of these genetic resources, providing genetic resources to protect their biodiversit y for the ultimate benefit of everyone. As stated by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005), \"many success stories show the effectiveness of direct payments and the transfer of property rights in providing incentives for local communities to conserve biodiversity\".</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Belgium has also signed the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture in 2002 (the ratification procedure is ongoing). Its objectives are the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from their use, in harmony with the Convention on Biological Diversity, for sustainable agriculture and food security. The core of the treaty is a \"multilateral system\" to facilitate access to the genetic resources of 64 major crops and forages and share the benefits in a fair and equitable way. The Treaty recognizes Farmers' Rights, which include the protection of traditional knowledge, and the right to participate equitably in benefit-sharing and in national decision-making about plant genetic resources.</p>\n\n<p>Belgium has already taken several initiatives with the purpose of implementing the ABS dispositions of the CBD through its patent legislation and by developing a voluntary code of conduct to help countries to comply with the requirements on Access and Benefit-Sharing for transferring microbial genetic resources (\"Micro-organisms Sustainable Use and Access Regulation International Code of Conduct, MOSAICC\"). Furthermore the Royal Botanic Garden of Belgium is a member of the International Plant Exchange Network (IPEN) programme of various EU botanic gardens for the exchange of plant material. IPEN allows participating gardens to exchange material for non-commercial purposes in accordance with the objectives of the CBD.</p>\n\n<p>However, Belgium needs to take further measures to translate the access and benefit-sharing dispositions into practice.</p>\n\n<p><em>* CBD instrument</em></p>\n\n<p><em>In 2002, the Parties to the CBD adopted the Bonn Guidelines on access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from their utilisation. These guidelines were developed to assist Parties when establishing legislative, administrative or policy measures on access and benefit-sharing and contracts and other arrangements under mutually agreed terms for access and benefit-sharing.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Guidelines identify the steps in the access and benefit-sharing process, with an emphasis on the obligation for users to seek the prior informed consent of providers. They also identify the basic requirements for mutually agreed terms and define the main roles and responsibilities of users and providers and stress the importance of the involvement of all stakeholders.</em></p>\n", "description_nl": "<p>De eerlijke en billijke verdeling van de voordelen voortvloeiend uit het gebruik van de genetische rijkdommen is de derde doelstelling van het VBD. Ze is even belangrijk als de andere twee om het doel om de achteruitgang van de biodiversiteit een halt toe te roepen tegen 2010 te realiseren.</p>\n\n<p>Duizenden jaren lang werden genetische rijkdommen* als vrij toegankelijk beschouwd. Ze werden initieel gebruikt door en uitgewisseld tussen landbouwers enerzijds en kwekers en telers anderzijds. Het specifiek op zoek gaan bestanddelen voor commerciele doeleinden op industriele schaal (bv. geneesmiddelen, lijmen, verven, parfums, drankjes, enz.) is een ontwikkeling van de laatste eeuw. Prospectoren mochten deze rijkdommen gewoon meenemen uit het land van herkomst om ze te gebruiken voor de ontwikkeling van commerciele producten, bv. farmacologisch actieve stoffen. Het VBD definieert nieuwe manieren voor het behandelen van activiteiten voor bioprospectie door de soevereine rechten van landen op hun genetische rijkdommen te erkennen. Het VBD moedigt aan om de resultaten van onderzoek en ontwikkeling en de voordelen die voortvloeien uit commercieel en ander gebruik van genetische rijkdommen op een eerlijke en billijke manier te delen met het land dat deze rijkdommen levert. Dit betekent dat landen die genetische rijkdommen leveren (vaak landen uit het zuiden, met een grote rijkdom aan biodiversiteit) bevoegd zijn om de toegangsvoorwaarden tot hun genetische rijkdommen te definieren.</p>\n\n<p>Om toegang te hebben tot genetische rijkdommen, moeten de gebruikers van de genetische rijkdommen:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>aan het land dat de genetische rijkdommen levert toestemming vragen om de genetische rijkdommen of de kennis te verzamelen of te gebruiken voor deze activiteit plaatsvindt (Voorafgaande geinformeerde toestemming*)  </li>\n<li>de voorwaarden voor de uitwisseling overeenkomen met het leverende land (Onderling overeengekomen voorwaarden*)  </li>\n<li>de voordelen voortvloeiend uit het gebruik van genetische rijkdommen op een eerlijke en billijke manier verdelen met de leveranciers van genetische rijkdommen (Eerlijke en billijke verdeling van de voordelen).

De naleving van de ABS-bepaling van het VBD is echter van cruciaal belang voor de biodiversiteit, aangezien dit een rechtstreekse stimulans inhoudt voor de biologisch rijke (maar vaak economisch armere) landen en de inheemse en lokale volkeren, die de voogd zijn van deze genetische hulpbronnen, die genetische rijkdommen leveren om hun biodiversiteit te beschermen, wat uiteindelijk ten voordele is van iedereen. Zoals vermeld in de 'Ecosystem Assessment' (2005), \"tonen talloze succesverhalen aan hoe efficient directe betalingen en de overdracht van eigendomsrechten zijn om lokale gemeenschappen te stimuleren om hun biodiversiteit in stand te houden\".</p>\n\n<p>In 2002 ondertekende Belgie ook het Internationaal Verdrag inzake Plantgenetische Hulpbronnen voor Voeding en Landbouw (de ratificatieprocedure is momenteel aan de gang). De doelstellingen van dit verdrag zijn het behoud en het duurzame gebruik van genetische plantenrijkdommen voor voedsel en landbouw en de eerlijke en billijke verdeling van voordelen uit hun gebruik met het oog op duurzame landbouw en voedselveiligheid, in overeenstemming met het Verdrag inzake Biologische Diversiteit. De kern van het verdrag is een 'multilateraal systeem' om de toegang tot genetische rijkdommen te vergemakkelijken voor 64 belangrijke gewassen en veevoeders en de voordelen op een eerlijke en billijke manier te delen. Het Verdrag erkent de rechten van landbouwers, waaronder de bescherming van de traditionele kennis, en het recht op een billijke deelname aan de verdeling van de voordelen en aan de nationale besluitvorming over genetische plantenrijkdommen.</p>\n\n<p>Belgie heeft al diverse initiatieven genomen met het oog op de implementatie van de ABS- bepalingen van het VBD door zijn wetgeving op de patenten en door het ontwikkelen van een vrijwillige gedragscode om landen te helpen om de voorwaarden voor de toegang tot en deling van voordelen voor de overdracht van microbiele genetische rijkdommen ('Micro-organisms Sustainable use and Access Regulation International Code of Conduct, MOSAICC') na te leven. Bovendien is de Nationale Plantentuin van Belgie lid van het International Plant Exchange Networkprogramma (IPEN) van plantentuinen in de EU met het oog op de uitwisseling van plantmaterialen. IPEN geeft de deelnemende tuinen de toestemming om materialen uit te wisselen voor niet-commerciele doeleinden in overeenstemming met de doelstellingen van het VBD.</p>\n\n<p>Toch moet Belgie nog bijkomende maatregelen nemen om nieuwe bepalingen over de toegang tot en de verdeling van voordelen in de praktijk te brengen.</p>\n\n<p><em>* VBD-instrument</em></p>\n\n<p><em>In 2002 keurden de Partijen van het VBD de begeleidende beginselen van Bonn goed over de toegang tot genetische rijkdommen en over de eerlijke en billijke verdeling van voordelen voortvloeiend uit het gebruik ervan.

Farming is an activity which goes beyond simple food production, affecting and using natural resources such as soil and water. Over the centuries, farming has contributed to the creation and maintenance of a large variety of agricultural landscapes (fields, pastures, quickset hedges, mixed woodland and pasture, etc.) which provide important semi-natural habitats for wildlife. Furthermore, the agricultural sector plays a multi-functional role as a food producer, biodiversity manager, motor for the economy in rural areas and guarantor of in situ conservation of local species, varieties and domestic animal breeds. However, in recent decades, intensification and specialisation of agriculture, and at the same time marginalisation and under-tilisation of land, have resulted in significant biodiversity loss in and around farmland. Farmland bird populations in particular have shown a decline over last decades.</p>\n\n<p>The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), together with broader developmental dynamics of the agricultural sector, was one of the drivers for processes causing biodiversity loss. The CAP has its roots in 1950s Western Europe, whose societies had been damaged by years of war, and where agriculture had been crippled and food supplies could not be guaranteed. The emphasis of the early CAP was on encouraging better productivity in the food chain so that consumers had a stable supply of affordable food, but also to ensure that the EU had a viable agricultural sector. The CAP offered subsidies and guaranteed prices to farmers, thus providing them with incentives to produce. Financial assistance was provided for the restructuring of farming, for example by aiding farm investment, aiming to ensure that farms increased in size and that farmers developed management and technology skills so that they were adapted to the economic and social climate of the day. This policy supported the removal of hedgerows and the draining of wetlands, and intensification exerted a variety of pressures on ecosystems (high fertiliser inputs, drainage, increasing cutting frequencies and grazing pressures).</p>\n\n<p>Since 1992, however, the CAP has been adapted to better integrate biodiversity needs. Increasing use of agri-environment measures, Good Farming Practice, organic farming and the support of Less Favoured Areas have favoured farmland biodiversity. The 2003 CAP reform (see box below) promotes these and other pro-biodiversity measures. Measures under market and income policy, including mandatory cross-compliance, the single farm payment (decoupling) and modulation, should provide indirect benefits to biodiversity. These measures have been implemented at EU level since 2005.</p>\n\n<p>Reducing pressure on biodiversity from agriculture is a big challenge for farmers in Belgium because our agriculture is one of the most intensive, specialised and productive in Europe. Furthermore, farmers are currently facing serious challenges with regard to the continuation of their profession. The number of farmers is decreasing every year. They leave the profession for various reasons, including competitive pressures from the market, compensation for the drop in prices by a rise in the cultivated area and risks posed by the move towards energetic crops. Between 1998 and 2005, 14,134 farms ceased their ctivities (21.5 percent of Belgian farmers) with the total agricultural area decreasing only slightly (decrease of only 0.4 percent), so that the average area per farm is growing (FPS Economy - Directorate-general Statistics Belgium, agriculture census 1998 and 200523).</p>\n\n<p><em>* CBD Instrument</em></p>\n\n<p><em>A multi-year Programme of Work on Agricultural Biodiversity was adopted in 2000 (CBD Decision V/5). The programme of work focuses on assessing the status and trends of the world's agricultural biodiversity and pays attention to identifying and promoting adaptive-management practices, technologies, policies and incentives. In addition, it promotes the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources that are of actual or potential value for food and agriculture. The programme of work focuses on various technical aspects of new technologies, such as Genetic Use of Restriction Technologies (GURT), and the potential implications of these technologies for agricultural biodiversity, biosecurity, farming and the economy. It also has as crosscutting initiatives the International Initiative for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Pollinators and an International Initiative for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Soil Biodiversity. The programme also supports, and sees cooperation with the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture signed by Belgium in 2002 (CBD Decision VI/6).</em></p>\n\n<p><em>* Current European agricultural policy</em></p>\n\n<p><em>In June 2003, EU agriculture ministers adopted a fundamental reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The new CAP is more oriented towards consumer and taxpayer demands, while giving EU farmers the freedom to produce what the market wants. The vast majority of subsidies are paid independently from the volume of production. To avoid abandonment of production, Member States can choose to maintain a limited link between subsidy and production under well-defined conditions. These new \"single farm payments\" for EU farmers, independent from production, are dependent on observation of a set of environmental, food safety, animal and plant health and animal welfare standards, as well as the requirement to keep all farmland in good agricultural and environmental condition (\"cross-compliance\").</em></p>\n\n<p><em>* Other key elements of the reformed CAP</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Strengthened rural development policy with more EU money, new measures to promote the environment, quality and animal welfare and to help farmers to meet EU production standards starting in 2005,</em></li>\n<li><em>Reduction in direct payments (\"modulation\") for bigger farms to finance the new rural development policy,</em></li>\n<li><em>Mechanism for financial discipline to ensure that the farm budget fixed until 2013 is not exceeded,</em></li>\n<li><em>Revisions to the market policy of the CAP: milk, cereals, rice, nuts, starch potatoes, dried fodder sectors</em></li>\n</ul>\n", "description_nl": "<p>Het belang van de landbouw voor het natuurlijk milieu en voor de biodiversiteit blijkt bijvoorbeeld uit het feit dat bijna de helft van het grondgebied in Belgi\u00eb bewerkt wordt voor de landbouw. Landbouw is een activiteit die verder gaat dan de gewone voedselproductie en die natuurlijke rijkdommen zoals bodem en water verbruikt en be\u00efnvloedt. Door de eeuwen heen heeft de landbouw bijgedragen tot de creatie en de instandhouding van een grote verscheidenheid aan landbouwlandschappen (velden, weiden, levende hagen, coulisselandschappen, ...) die vaak belangrijke semi-natuurlijke habitats voor wilde fauna en flora vormen. Bovendien speelt de landbouwsector een multifunctionele rol als voedselproducent, beheerder van de biodiversiteit, motor van de economie in landelijke gebieden, borg voor behoud in situ van lokale soorten, vari\u00ebteiten en inheemse dierenrassen. In de laatste decennia hebben de intensifi\u00ebring en de specialisatie van de landbouw, en tegelijkertijd de marginalisatie en het ondergebruik van land, geleid tot een aanzienlijk verlies van de biodiversiteit op en rond landbouwgrond. Zo zijn de vogelpopulaties in landbouwgebied de laatste decennia duidelijk afgenomen.</p>\n\n<p>Het Gemeenschappelijk Landbouwbeleid (GLB) was samen met de bredere ontwikkelingsdynamiek van de landbouwsector \u00e9\u00e9n van de drijvende krachten voor processen die geleid hebben tot het verlies van de biodiversiteit. De oorsprong van het GLB ligt in het West-Europa van de jaren 1950, met zijn landen die te lijden hadden gehad onder de oorlog, waar de landbouw lamgelegd was en de voedseltoevoer niet gewaarborgd kon worden. De nadruk van het vroege GLB lag op het aanmoedigen van een betere productiviteit in de voedselketen, zodat de consumenten konden rekenen op een stabiele toevoer van betaalbaar voedsel, maar ook op het garanderen van een leefbare landbouwsector in de EU. Het GLB bood landbouwers subsidies en gewaarborgde prijzen aan en gaf hun stimuli om te produceren. Er werd financi\u00eble steun verleend voor de herstructurering van de landbouw, bijvoorbeeld door het verlenen van steun voor investeringen in landbouwbedrijven, met het doel te garanderen dat de boerderijen groter werden in omvang en betere beheersen technologische vaardigheden kregen, zodat ze aangepast waren aan het toenmalige economische en sociale klimaat. Dat beleid steunde het verwijderen van hagen en het droogleggen van watergebieden en zorgde door de intensifi\u00ebring voor een toenemende druk op de ecosystemen (grote aanvoer van meststoffen, drooglegging, hogere oogstfrequentie en grotere druk door begrazing).</p>\n\n<p>Maar sinds 1992 werd het GLB aangepast om de behoeften van de biodiversiteit beter te integreren. Het toenemend gebruik van agromilieumaatregelen, goede landbouw praktijken, organische landbouw en de ondersteuning van Achtergestelde Gebieden, waren bevorderlijk voor de biodiversiteit van de landbouwgrond. De hervorming van het GLB in 2003 (zie kader hieronder) promoot deze en andere biodiversiteitsbevorderende maatregelen. Maatregelen in het kader van het markt- en inkomstenbeleid, waaronder verplichte cross\u2013compliance, de \u201csingle farm payment\u201d (ontkoppeling) en modulering, moeten de biodiversiteit onrechtstreeks bevorderen. Deze maatregelen werden op EU-niveau ge\u00efmplementeerd sinds 2005.</p>\n\n<p>Het verminderen van de druk van de landbouw op de biodiversiteit is een grote uitdaging voor Belgische landbouwers, omdat onze landbouw \u00e9\u00e9n van de meest intensieve, gespecialiseerde en productieve in Europa is. Bovendien staan landbouwers momenteel voor een echte uitdaging om te zorgen dat hun beroep blijft voortbestaan. Het aantal landbouwers daalt elk jaar omwille van de uitstap uit het beroep, de hoge concurrentiedruk uit de markt, het compenseren van de dalende prijzen door een toename van de bebouwde oppervlakte en de risico\u2019s door de overgang naar energetische vegetatie. Tussen 1998 en 2005 hebben 14.134 landbouwbedrijven hun activiteiten stopgezet (21,5 percent van de Belgische landbouwers), maar de totale landbouwoppervlakte neemt slechts lichtjes af (een daling met slechts 0,4 percent). De gemiddelde oppervlakte per landbouwbedrijf neemt dus toe (FOD Economie \u2013 Directoraat-generaal Statistiek Belgi\u00eb, landbouwtelling 1998 en 200523).</p>\n\n<p><em>* VBD-instrument</em></p>\n\n<p><em>In 2000 werd een Meerjarenwerkprogramma over de Agrobiodiversiteit goedgekeurd (VBD-besluit V/5).

Bovendien wordt het behoud en het duurzame gebruik van genetische rijkdommen gepromoot die een re\u00eble of potenti\u00eble waarde hebben voor het voedsel en de landbouw.

De meeste subsidies worden uitbetaald onafhankelijk van het productievolume. Om een verwaarlozing van de productie te voorkomen, kunnen de Lidstaten opteren om onder duidelijk omschreven voorwaarden een beperkte link in stand te houden tussen subsidies en productie. Deze nieuwe \u201csingle farm payments\u201d voor EU-landbouwers zijn onafhankelijk van de productie, maar zijn wel afhankelijk van het respecteren van de normen op het vlak van milieu, voedselveiligheid, gezondheid van plant en dier en dierenwelzijn, en van de eisen om de goede landbouw- en milieutoestand van alle landbouwgrond in stand te houden (\u201ccross-compliance\u201d).</em></p>\n\n<p><em>* Andere belangrijke elementen van het hervormde GLB</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Versterkt beleid voor de plattelandsontwikkeling met meer EU-geld, nieuwe maatregelen om het milieu, de kwaliteit en het dierenwelzijn te promoten en om landbouwers te helpen om vanaf 2005 te voldoen aan de EU-productienormen,</em></li>\n<li><em>Beperking van rechtstreekse betalingen (\u201cmodulering\u201d) voor grotere landbouwbedrijven om het nieuwe beleid voor de ontwikkeling van landelijke gebieden te financieren,</em></li>\n<li><em>Mechanisme voor financi\u00eble discipline om te garanderen dat he0t landbouwbudget dat werd vastgelegd tot 2013 niet wordt overschreden;</em></li>\n<li><em>Herzieningen van het marktbeleid van het GLB: sectoren melk, graangewassen, rijst, noten, zetmeelaardappelen, droog veevoeder.</em></li>\n</ul>\n", "actions": [], "description_fr": "<p>L\u2019importance de l\u2019agriculture pour l\u2019environnement naturel et pour la biodiversit\u00e9 est accentu\u00e9e par le fait que pr\u00e8s de la moiti\u00e9 de la surface des terres en Belgique est cultiv\u00e9e.

La PAC trouve son origine dans l\u2019Europe occidentale des ann\u00e9es 50, dont les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ont subi des ann\u00e9es de guerre, o\u00f9 l\u2019agriculture avait \u00e9t\u00e9 paralys\u00e9e et o\u00f9 les approvisionnement en nourriture ne pouvaient \u00eatre garantis.

La PAC offrait des subsides et des prix garantis aux agriculteurs, les incitant ainsi \u00e0 produire. Une assistance financi\u00e8re \u00e9tait fournie pour restructurer l\u2019exploitation, par exemple par le biais d\u2019une contribution aux investissements dans la ferme, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 s\u2019assurer que les fermes prennent de l\u2019ampleur et d\u00e9veloppent des comp\u00e9tences en mati\u00e8re de gestion et de technologie afin de s\u2019adapter au climat \u00e9conomique et social du moment. Cette politique \u00e0 encourager la suppression des haies, le drainage des zones mar\u00e9cageuses et l\u2019intensification a exerc\u00e9 diverses pressions sur les \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes (apport important d\u2019engrais, drainage, fr\u00e9quence croissante des fauches et pressions de pacage).</p>\n\n<p>Toutefois, depuis 1992, la PAC a \u00e9t\u00e9 adapt\u00e9e pour mieux int\u00e9grer les besoins de la biodiversit\u00e9. L\u2019augmentation de l\u2019utilisation de mesures agri-environnementales, de bonnes pratiques agricole, de l\u2019agriculture biologique ainsi que le soutien aux zones moins favoris\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 b\u00e9n\u00e9fiques \u00e0 la biodiversit\u00e9 des zones agricoles.

Besides professional fishermen, also recreational fishermen are active at sea.</p>\n\n<p>Fishery and aquaculture in the North Sea are governed by the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), established in 1983 and reviewed in 1992 and 2002. The CFP takes into account the biological, economic and social dimensions of fishing. The CFP addresses four main areas, dealing with (1) conservation of fish stocks (such as establishment of total allowable catches (TACs) of sea fish that can safely be caught every year to allow for renewal of fish stock), (2) structures (such as vessels, port facilities and fish-processing plants), (3) the common organisation of the market and (4) an external fisheries policy which includes fishing agreements with non-Community members and negotiations in international organisations.</p>\n\n<p>The EU Marine Strategy on the protection and conservation of the marine environment (expected in 2005) has four objectives: (1) to protect, conserve and improve the quality of the marine environment; (2) to phase out pollution; (3) to control the use of marine services and goods and other activities in marine areas that have, or may have, a negative impact on the status of the marine environment; and (4) to apply the principles of good governance both within Europe and globally.An important national instrument is the Law of 20 January 1999 on the protection of the marine environment in the areas under Belgian jurisdiction. This foresees the identification and designation of marine protected areas (among others in application of the EU Habitat and Birds Directives). Work on MPAs and threatened and declining species is also ongoing under OSPAR. Measures for MPAs are currently being finalised and will be published soon. Management measures for all relevant sectors will be included in the instruments to be published and the necessary conflict analysis has been conducted with all of these sectors, including fisheries.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Inland waters</strong></p>\n\n<p>In Belgium, inland water fishery can be considered to be a leisure activity or a sport. It is practised mostly for entertainment and on a limited basis for food, both in artificial areas specially managed for fishing (private ponds, fishing grounds) and in the public hydrographic network of rivers and canals. Belgium's current legislation only covers the management of the public hydrographical network. Several improvements in the management of standing waters by fishermen should be promoted both to ensure an ecological management of the aquatic ecosystems and improve the quality of the local fish populations.</p>\n\n<p>Belgium is a Party to the Ramsar Convention on the protection of wetlands (i.e. inland waters and marine waters) established in 1971 which provides the framework for conservation and sustainable utilisation of wetlands.\nThe ICES Code of Practice on the Introductions and Transfers of Marine Organisms sets forth recommended procedures and practices to diminish the risks of detrimental effects from the intentional introduction and transfer of marine (including brackish water) organisms (ICES, 2005).</p>\n\n<p><em>* CBD instruments</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Programme of Work on Marine and Coastal biodiversity adopted in 1998 (CBD Decision IV/5) aims to assist the implementation of the Jakarta Mandate, the CBD's general framework for action on marine and coastal biodiversity, at the national, regional and global levels.

Belgische schepen brengen slechts 1% van het totale visbestand aan wal van de landen die grenzen aan de Noordzee. Belgische vissers brengen jaarlijks ongeveer 30.000 ton vis25 (meestal platvis en kabeljauw) aan wal. Andere mariene producten (garnalen en oesters) en de productie door aquacultuur* in zee- en binnenwateren zijn beperkt. Toch wordt de mariene biodiversiteit sterk bedreigd in onze kustzone en epicontinentale zee, waar directe en indirecte verstoringen geconcentreerd zijn. Twee belangrijke bedreigingen zijn de overexploitatie van de mariene rijkdommen en de schadelijke effecten van bepaalde vismethodes (zoals sleepnetten) op de zeebodem, niet alleen door Belgische vissers, maar ook door vissersboten van andere landen die actief zijn in Belgi\u00eb. Ondanks de creatie van diverse internationale instrumenten om de visserij en de impact ervan op het milieu te reglementeren, is de druk op het mariene ecosysteem en de vispopulaties de voorbije tien jaar drastisch toegenomen. Zowel professionele vissers als vrijetijdsvissers zijn actief op zee.</p>\n\n<p>Visserij en aquacultuur in de Noordzee zijn geregeld in de Gemeenschappelijk Visserijbeleid (GVB) van de EU dat in 1983 werd opgesteld en later werd herzien in 1992 en 2002. Het GVB houdt rekening met de biologische, economische en sociale dimensie van de visserij. Het GVB behandelt vier belangrijke domeinen die te maken hebben met (1) het behoud van het visbestand (zoals het bepalen van de totale toegestane vangsten (TAC\u2019s of \u201ctotal allowable catches\u201d) van zeevis die per jaar veilig kan worden gevangen om te zorgen dat het visbestand zich kan vernieuwen), (2) structuren (zoals schepen, haveninfrastructuur en visverwerkende bedrijven), (3) de gemeenschappelijke organisatie van de markt en (4) een extern visserijbeleid dat visserijovereenkomsten omvat met landen die geen lid zijn van de Unie en onderhandelingen in internationale organisaties.</p>\n\n<p>De Europese Mariene Strategie inzake de bescherming en het behoud van het mariene milieu (verwacht in 2005) heeft vier doelstellingen: (1) de kwaliteit van het mariene milieu beschermen, behouden en verbeteren; (2) pollutie elimineren; (3) het gebruik van mariene diensten en goederen en andere activiteiten in mariene gebieden die een negatieve invloed (kunnen) hebben op de status van het mariene milieu onder controle houden; (4) de principes van goed bestuur toepassen, zowel binnen Europa als wereldwijd.</p>\n\n<p>Een belangrijk nationaal instrument is de Wet van 20 januari 1999 ter bescherming van het mariene milieu in de zeegebieden onder de rechtsbevoegdheid van Belgi\u00eb. Dit instrument voorziet de identificatie en aanwijzing van beschermde mariene gebieden (in toepassing van o.a. de EU-Vogel- en Habitatrichtlijn). In het kader van OSPAR wordt ook gewerkt aan maatregelen voor beschermde mariene gebieden en bedreigde en afnemende soorten. Momenteel wordt de laatste hand gelegd aan maatregelen voor beschermde mariene gebieden die binnenkort zullen worden gepubliceerd. Beheersmaatregelen voor alle relevante sectoren maken deel uit van de te publiceren instrumenten en de noodzakelijke conflictanalyse werd uitgevoerd met al deze sectoren, inclusief de visserij.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Binnenwateren</strong></p>\n\n<p>In Belgi\u00eb kan de visserij op de binnenwateren worden beschouwd als een vrijetijdsbesteding of een sport. Ze wordt meestal beoefend voor het plezier en slechts in beperkte mate voor voeding. Visserij op de binnenwateren vindt meestal plaats in kunstmatige gebieden die speciaal worden beheerd voor de visserij (priv\u00e9vijvers, visgronden) en in het openbaar hydrografisch netwerk van rivieren en kanalen. De huidige Belgische wetgeving dekt alleen het beheer van het openbaar hydrografisch netwerk. Diverse verbeteringen aan het beheer van staand water door vissers moeten worden gepromoot om een ecologisch beheer van de waterecosystemen te garanderen en om de kwaliteit van de lokale vispopulaties te verbeteren.</p>\n\n<p>Belgi\u00eb ondertekende het Verdrag van Ramsar inzake de bescherming van watergebieden (binnenwateren en zeewateren) dat werd opgesteld in 1971 en dat het kader vormt voor het behoud en duurzame gebruik van watergebieden.</p>\n\n<p>De \u201cICES Code of Practice on the Introductions and Transfers of Marine Organisms\u201d beschrijft aanbevolen procedures en praktijken om de risico\u2019s van de schadelijke effecten van de opzettelijke introductie en transfer van mariene organismen (inclusief brak water) (ICES, 2005) te beperken.</p>\n\n<p><em>* VBD-instrumenten</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Het Werkprogramma inzake Zee- en Kustbiodiversiteit dat werd goedgekeurd in 1998 (VBD-besluit IV/5) streeft naar de implementatie van het Mandaat van Jakarta, het algemene kader van het VBD voor acties op het vlak van biodiversiteit in mariene en kustgebieden, op nationaal, regionaal en wereldwijd niveau.

Onrechtstreeks bedreigen zij ook de productieve rijkdom van de bossen. Om te garanderen dat de biodiversiteit in Belgische bossen in stand wordt gehouden, is het nodig te werken aan kwantitatieve aspecten (bv. een halt toeroepen aan ontbossing en fragmentatie) en kwalitatieve aspecten.

Het leidende beginsel daarbij moet de promotie van een duurzaam bosbeheer zijn. Duurzaam bosbeheer (SFM) wordt gedefinieerd als \u2018het beheer en gebruik van bossen en boslanden op een manier en aan een tempo die hun biodiversiteit, productiviteit, regeneratievermogen, vitaliteit en hun potentieel in stand houdt om nu en in de toekomst relevante ecologische, economische en sociale functies te vervullen, op lokaal, nationaal en wereldwijd niveau, en geen schade veroorzaakt aan andere ecosystemen\u2019 (Ministeri\u00eble Conferentie over de Bescherming van Bossen in Europa, 1993).

It generates a societal debate with discussions on the pro and cons, and compromises always have to be reached. There has been an evolution over the last 20 years, with cooperation between hunters, foresters, farmers and conservationists improving. Important progress has been made in putting new wildlife management insights into practice and in recognising the ecological interactions between hunting and biodiversity.</p>\n\n<p>Belgian hunting was regulated by a law of 1882 but is now a full competence of the Regions, with different regulations in Flanders, Wallonia, and Brussels Capital Region. These laws differ between the Regions to better fit the respective game situations. The law of 1882 was first revised by the Regions in the 1990s<a href=\"\">29</a> in order to obtain a sustainable use of wild species and their habitats. In Brussels Capital Region, hunting is completelyprohibited since 1991. Since the 1990s, modifications of Walloon and Flemish laws on hunting, along with efforts from hunters, aim to a sustainable use of wild species and their habitats.</p>\n\n<p>In Flanders, management plans for the game management units are controlled, and if necessary amended, by the responsible Minister on a 6 years basis. In Flanders and in Wallonia, cull plans in general are drawn up every year for the most part by game management units for certain big game (red deer in Wallonia and roe deer in Flanders) and approved by the Regions in order to guarantee a coordinated management of these types of game.</p>\n\n<p>Since 1978, both in Flanders and in Wallonia, a compulsory hunting exam aims to guarantee best safety practices, ethics, and good knowledge of game species and their habitats.</p>\n\n<p>For birds, the Council Directive 79/409/EEC provides the framework for the management of bird-hunting in the EU. The Guidance document on hunting under Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds published by the European Commission in 2004 accepts hunting activity in accordance with the general objectives of the Birds Directive.

The creation and approval of game management units has had a major impact on vision and attitudes of hunters in Belgium.

Uit gegevens blijkt dat ongeveer 50 percent van de belangrijkste rassen in de veeteelt (runderen, varkens, schapen, geiten en kippen) in de 15 oorspronkelijke EU-landen ofwel uitgestorven zijn, ofwel in gevaar zijn of een kritieke status hebben (EMA, 2006).</p>\n\n<p>Biologische en genetische diversiteit in de landbouw zijn essentieel voor de duurzame ontwikkeling van de landbouwproductie en van plattelandsgebieden.

Daarnaast bevat genetisch gediversifieerd voedsel een grotere vari\u00ebteit aan voedingsstoffen die nuttig zijn voor een goede algemene gezondheid en weerstand tegen ziekten. De nodige maatregelen moeten worden getroffen om het volledige potentieel van deze biodiversiteit te verzamelen, te behouden, in kaart te brengen en op een duurzame manier te gebruiken, teneinde de algemene doelstellingen van het GLB te promoten.

Total achievement of annual big game cull plans and game management plans will help restore the equilibrium between economical, ecological and social functions of forest and countryside. High densities of ungulates are locally a problem for foresters that can be managed in partnership with hunters. Populations of big game have increased over the last 20 years due to a lack of severe winter periods for several years, the positive effect of storms on forests' nutritional potential (CEEW, 2000), but also due to the absence of natural predators since more than 150 years and hunters' tendency to protect females of big game and the feeding of wild boar (CEEW, 2005). This phenomenon has led to an over-density of total population of wild boar, roe deer and red deer in Wallonia (a similar evolution is observed in neighbouring regions) which locally cause damages to trees, hamper forest regeneration, threat several species and sensitive habitats, and cause other problems, including in suburban zones.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to develop legal instruments in order to enable taking concrete measures for field management on favour of biodiversity.

Zo zou men aandacht moeten besteden aan het cre\u00ebren en onderhouden van schuilplaatsen voor klein wild, voornamelijk in landbouwgebieden.

Hoge dichtheden van hoefdieren vormen een plaatselijk probleem voor boswachters dat in samenwerking met de jagers kan worden aangepakt. De laatste 20 jaar zijn de grofwildpopulaties toegenomen door het uitblijven van strenge winterperiodes gedurende een aantal jaren, door het positieve effect van stormen op de voedselcapaciteit van de bossen (CEEW, 2000), maar ook door het ontbreken van natuurlijke vijanden sinds meer dan 150 jaar en de gewoonte van jagers om het vrouwelijk grofwild te beschermen en everzwijnen te voederen (CEEW, 2005).
